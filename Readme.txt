First lab content
implement binary search and sequential search using recursion and compare its times for a three sets of number
 generated randomly each set has a  different size rage first set 1000 items ,second set  10000 items and third set 100000 items

Second lab content
implement Fibonacci  series
using recursion , array as dynamic programing and powering methods.

Third lab
Order Statistics.
Implement a program that takes as input an integer array of size n, and an index i, and returns the ith smallest element in the array.
Key idea: Implement an algorithm that behaves just like quick sort but explores only at one side of the pivot.

Fourth Lab
Heap Sort;Implement a program that takes as input an integer array of size n, and sorts the array using heap structure.

Fifth Lab
Skip list is a data structure that’s built to improve the search complexity in linked list.
In skip list multiple levels of linked lists are built over the original linked list to provide similar
experience to the random access and skip some nodes.
Task:
1- Create a Skip list and Node class
2- Implement insert node function  in skipList class
3- Implement Search key function in skipList class
4-Implement Print key function in skipList class
Write code in main that create skip list and calls insert , search and disply functions.


Sixth Lab:

implement  Fractional Knapsack. Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break items. We either take the whole item or don’t take it. 
In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack.






Seventh Lab:

Let’s assume today is your lucky day. You are walking in an electronics mall and you’ve won a
 free voucher with 30k EGP that you could use to select from the following set of devices [Gaming 
 PC, Apple Watch, Iphone 12, DVD-Set, Samsung Galaxy S12+, Apple Mac Box Air, Mac Pro] where the devices 
 prices as follow: [8k, 3k, 5k, 1k, 4k, 20k, 7k, 22K] and devices profit resale values is as follow: 
 [14k, 5k, 8k, 3k, 6k, 28k, 10k, 27K]. Please note each item can only selected once.

You are requested 
 to implement a C++ program that find the devices you could select so you get the maximum profile resale
 value such that their total price/cost doesn’t exceed your voucher value.
